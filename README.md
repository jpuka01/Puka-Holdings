Puka Holdings is a diversified global enterprise with a dynamic portfolio of
brands. Our flagship businesses include Puka Creations, an established
import-export company in trending items and jewelry for over 30 years, and Puka
Gida, a food conglomerate that spans a döner fast food chain, delicatessen
shops, a family restaurant, and a large-scale industrial farm. With a presence
across the globe, Puka Holdings also owns a jewelry manufacturing plant in
China, dairy and meat processing facilities in Turkey, and has since recently
expanded into the textile industry with the investment of a startup company,
Supasoft Apparel based in Las Vegas. Our ventures also extend to high-end
dining experiences and bakeries in China, embodying our commitment to
innovative growth across industries.

At Puka Holdings, we mainly cater to business professionals, entrepreneurs, and

ventures — from food services and manufacturing to apparel and beyond — we are
able to reach and connect with a global audience that simply wouldn’t be
possible without a website. The site not only highlights our capabilities but

## Questions
### What was the most satisfying part of the assignment?
I found the creative freedom in designing and structuring the website to be the most satisfying part of the assignment. Being able to start from a blank canvas and experiment with different layouts, color schemes, and typography allowed me to bring my vision to life. I particularly enjoyed the challenge of balancing aesthetics with functionality, ensuring that the website was both visually appealing and user-friendly. Additionally, seeing the final product come together after iterative improvements was incredibly rewarding, as it showcased the progress I made in refining my design and coding skills.

### What was the most challenging part of this assignment?
Working exclusively with HTML and CSS challenged me to fully leverage the capabilities of these languages to the best of my knowledge. Having previously worked with frameworks like React and JavaScript, I found the limitations of HTML and CSS alone to be surprisingly restrictive, especially in designing more dynamic elements for my website. This constraint forced me to think creatively within the boundaries of basic web technologies.
